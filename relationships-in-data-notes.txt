Statistics in Data
A branch of mathematics that deals with collecting, organizing, and interpreting data

Statistics
	1. Descriptive Statistics
		A. Univariate 
			- single variable
			i. Measures of Frequency
				- Frequency tables
					- how often a particular category or value appears in data set
				- Histograms
					- bin continuous data and see how many data points fall within a certain bin
			
			ii. Measures of Central Tendency
			- a central or a typical value for a probability distribution
			- data set can be visualized as points on a number line 
				a. Average (Mean)
					- serves as headline for data set
					- one number that best represents all of these data points
					- calculate by taking the sum of all the points on the number line and divide by the number of points
						
						xbar or avg = sum(x1 + x2 + ... + xn) / n
						
					- gives idea around some central point in data
					
				b. Median - data at 50th percentile
				    Median = 50th percentile: 50% of points on either side

				c. Mode - most common value within data set
				
				Other infrequently used measures:
					- Geometric Mean
						- typically used in business, finance
						- calculate growth rates and returns on a portfolios of securities
					- Harmonic Mean 
						- average travel speed given the duration of several trips
			
			iii. Measures of Dispersion
				- capture how does data jump around
				
				Variation is important.  "Do the numbers jump around?"
				
				a. Range - maxiumum minus minimum
					Range = Xmax - Xmin
						
						- the range ignores the mean, and is swayed by outliers 
							- that's where variance comes in
						
					Because range is so sensitive to the presence of outliers in data, it is not often used to measure variation.
						
				b. Inter-quartile range (IQR) - range between 75th percentile [Q3] minus 25th percentile [Q1]
					- helps pinpoint outliers
					- [Q3] = 75th percentile: 75% of points smaller than this
					- [Q1] = 25th percentile: 25% of points smaller than this
					
					Inter-quartile Range (IQR) = 75th percentile - 25th percentile
					
				c. Standard deviation and Variance
					
					When summarizing a set of data points:
						*Variance is the second-most important number
						
					- Variance of data is a measurement of dispersion.
					To calculate Variance, first need to calculate mean deviation.
					
					Mean Deviation: mean value subtracted from all data points.
					
					- Mean Deviation = xi - xbar
						
					- Squared Mean Deviation = (xi - xbar)^2
						
					Variance = sum(xi - xbar)^2 / n
					
						*Bessel's Correction:
							BC's Variance = sum(xi - xbar)^2 / (n - 1)
							- During calculation, we can improve our estimate of the variance by tweaking the denominator 
					
					Standard Deviation = sqrRoot(Variance) = sqrRoot(sum(xi - xbar)^2 / n)	
					
						- can tell us how far a particular data point falls from the mean.
						- outliers might represent data errors, or genuinely rare points legitimately in a dataset.
							- Data points may be expresssed as one standard deviation away from the mean, two standard deviations away from mean, or three, etc.
							- outliers may represent data errors or genuinely rare points
								- outlier is considered some point more than three stadard deviations away from the mean.
							
					
		B. Bivariate 
			- relationships between two variables
			
			i. Correlation
				- strength, as well as linear strength between two variables
				- basically a function of the covariance
				- standardized
				
			ii. Covariance
				- join variability of two random variables
				- if greater values of one variable mainly correspond with the greater values of the other variable, and the same holds for the lesser values, the covariance is positive.
				- not standardized 
			
		c. Multivariate 
			- relationships between multiple variables
			
			i. Correlation Matrix
				- provides correlation values for each point in your data
				
			ii. Covariance Matrix
				- provides covariance data for each point in your data
		
	2. Inferential Statistics
		A. Hypothesis
			- Asks "are the assumptions held about data are true or not?"
		
		B. Model Fitting 
			- a part of predictive analytics
			- use insights extracted from data to make predictions or decisions
			- Machine Learning techniques are a part of this
